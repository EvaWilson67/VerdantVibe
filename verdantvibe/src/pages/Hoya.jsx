                                fragrant, waxy flowers and thick, glossy leaves. They are easy to care for and make
                                great houseplants, often growing as trailing vines or climbers when given proper
                                support."
        fact="Hoyas are known for their ability to bloom year after year, especially if theyâ€™re given
                                the right conditions."
        care="They grow slowly, so you won't need to worry about constant maintenance. If
                                you notice the leaves becoming floppy or discolored, it may be a sign of overwatering."
        li1="Light: Prefer bright, indirect light "
        li2="Watering: Water when the soil is dry to the touch"
        li3="Humidity: Enjoys higher humidity but can adapt to average indoor humidity"
        care2=" Well-draining soil, like cactus or succulent mix, is ideal. Additionally, feed with a
                                balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer), but reduce
                                fertilization in the fall and winter."
