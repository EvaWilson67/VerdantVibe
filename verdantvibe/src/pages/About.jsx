              I am not good at keeping house plants or gardening. However, it is
              something that I am working towards. I don't have a lot of hobbies
              because my focus has always been my academic studies. I got into
              plant keeping because of my grandmother and I would like to keep
              the legacy going. It's okay to do hobbies your not good at (two of
              my plants are activley struggling because they are brats), so this
              project is a great way to represent that although you may not be
              good at something, the struggle in that hobby can be something to
              look forward to.
