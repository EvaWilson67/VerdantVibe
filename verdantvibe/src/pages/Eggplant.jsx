        description=" Technically a berry, the eggplant is related to tomatoes, chili peppers, and potatoes. It
                            was originally domesticated from wild nightshade species, such as thorn or bitter apple,
                            likely through two independent domesticationsâ€”one in South Asia and another in East Asia.
                            There is still no consensus on its exact origin, with some sources suggesting South Asia,
                            where it continues to grow wild, while others point to Africa. Eggplant has been cultivated
                            in southern and eastern Asia since prehistoric times. (wikipedia)"
