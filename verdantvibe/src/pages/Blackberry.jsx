        description="  They likely came from temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere before spreading across
                            the globe. Blackberries were thought to be a part of the hunter-gatherersâ€™ diets across
                            the world, and many indigenous (including Native Americans) have eaten blackberries for
                            centuries. One of the earliest known instances of humans enjoying blackberries is estimated
                            to be from approximately 500 BC."
